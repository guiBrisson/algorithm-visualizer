# Selection sort

In computer science, selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(n²) 
time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the 
similar insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity and has performance advantages 
over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory 
is limited.

The time efficiency of selection sort is quadratic, so there are a number of sorting techniques
which have better time complexity than selection sort. 

## Complexity
| Name        | **Selection sort** |
|-------------|--------------------|
| **Best**    | n²                 |
| **Average** | n²                 |
| **Worst**   | n²                 |
| **Memory**  | 1                  |
| **Stable**  | No                 |
