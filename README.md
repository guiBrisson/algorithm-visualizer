# Algorithm Visualizer

Algorithm Visualizer is an Android application that allows you to visualize sorting algorithms in action, making learning algorithms more accessible and engaging.

**Note: This project was developed within a one-week timeframe and is currently a work in progress. I'm actively working on adding new features and improvements.**
